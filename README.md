Sequential Shadows
==================
Curly / Medieval presents

![Sequential Shadows logo](docs/sequential-shadows.png)

my contribution to the Tiny Tapeout 8 demo competition.
Code, graphics, and music by Curly (Toivo Henningsson) of Medieval.

This is the deluxe version, with Pmod VGA RGB444 output support and a few changes from the original, in 2x2 tiles compared to the original's 1x2. Specifically, it's the IHP tapeout of the deluxe version; the original deluxe version can be found at https://github.com/toivoh/tt08-demo-deluxe.

The demo can be seen at https://youtu.be/pkiTu3iLA_U (captured from a Verilator simulation).
